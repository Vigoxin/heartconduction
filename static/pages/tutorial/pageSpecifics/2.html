<h4>Time</h4>

<p>In the real world, time is continuous. But here, time is divided into discrete units called <strong>frames</strong>. The <strong>framerate</strong> (in frames per second) determines how fast the animation will run.</p>

<p class="instructions">Try slowing the framerate (e.g. to 10) by adjusting <span class="will-highlight-element-on-window" data-el-to-highlight=".fps-slider">the slider</span> or <span class="will-highlight-element-on-window" data-el-to-highlight=".fps-number">the number panel</span>. Then click on the cell again and watch it undergo an action potential.</p>

<p>You can also stop and restart the animation with the <span class="will-highlight-element-on-window" data-el-to-highlight=".play-button">play/pause button</span>. When paused, you can advance the animation one frame at a time by clicking on the <span class="will-highlight-element-on-window" data-el-to-highlight=".frame-button">advance frame button</span></p>

<p class="instructions">Try the following:
	<ol class="instructions">
		<li><span class="will-highlight-element-on-window" data-el-to-highlight=".play-button">Pause</span> the animation</li>
		<li>Click on the <span class="will-highlight-element-on-window" data-el-to-highlight=".canvas-parent>canvas">cell</span> again to depolarise it</li>
		<li><span class="will-highlight-element-on-window" data-el-to-highlight=".frame-button">Advance</span> the animation frame by frame</li>
	</ol>
