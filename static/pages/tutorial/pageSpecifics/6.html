<h4>Random refractory period lengths</h4>

<p>In real life, the <strong>refractory period</strong> of every cell in a region will not be <strong>exactly the same</strong>. To simulate this, we can introduce some randomness to the the length of action potentials.</p>

<p>So far we have seen impulse propagation across a 1-dimensional path. However, we can also watch an impulse propagate across a 2D grid of cells.</p>

<ol class="instructions">
	<li>Start by <span class="will-highlight-element-on-window" data-el-to-highlight="label[for='state-radio-depo']">depolarising</span> the <span class="will-highlight-grid-section-on-window" data-grid-section-to-highlight="[[0,9],[0,9]]">left-most middle cell</span>, and observe the impulse propagate across the two separated regions.</li>
	<li>Select the button to activate <span class="will-highlight-element-on-window" data-el-to-highlight="label[for='randomRefracLengths-radio-on']">turning on random refractory period lengths</span>.</li>
	<li>Next we need to activate this on all the cells in the <span class="will-highlight-grid-section-on-window" data-grid-section-to-highlight="[[0,10],[29,19]]">lower region of the grid</span>. <span class="general-tips">To activate multiple cells at the same time with the same setting, hold shift then click and drag to select a rectangular region of cells. When you release the mouse, all cells within the purple corner markers will be activated with the current setting.</span> In this case, make sure you cover the whole <span class="will-highlight-grid-section-on-window" data-grid-section-to-highlight="[[0,10],[29,19]]">lower region</span> with the purple corner markers. </li>
	<li><span class="will-highlight-element-on-window" data-el-to-highlight="label[for='state-radio-depo']">Depolarise</span> the <span class="will-highlight-grid-section-on-window" data-grid-section-to-highlight="[[0,9],[0,9]]">left-most middle cell</span> again and observe how random refractory periods affect impulse propagation in the lower region.</li>
</ol>

<p class="general-tips">Random refractory periods are useful to demonstrate certain features (e.g. the onset and maintenance of fibrillation), however for the sake of simplicity, this is turned off in all simulations except where it is specifically useful.</p>
