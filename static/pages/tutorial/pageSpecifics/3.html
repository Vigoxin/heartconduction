<h4>Impulse Propagation</h4>

<p>An action potential in one cell can trigger an action potential in neighbouring cells, and in this way an <strong>electrical impulse</strong> can be transmitted across many cells. The transmission happens specifically <strong>during the upstroke</strong>/at the very beginning of the action potential.</p>

<p class="instructions">The simulation below starts off paused. Try the following:
	<ol class="instructions">
		<li>Depolarise the <span class="will-highlight-grid-section-on-window" data-grid-section-to-highlight="[[0,0],[0,0]]">left-most cell</span></li>
		<li>Advance frame by frame and watch the action potential diagrams for the middle 3 cells.</li>
		<li>Then depolarise the <span class="will-highlight-grid-section-on-window" data-grid-section-to-highlight="[[0,0],[19,0]]">right-most cell</span> and note the difference</li>
	</ol>
