<h4>Conduction velocity</h4>

<p>The actional potential shape of cells <strong>on an individual level can affect</strong> how an impulse propagates across <strong>multiple cells on a macroscopic level</strong>. One important macroscopic feature is conduction velocity. The main determinant of conduction velocity is the speed of the upstroke of the action potential of individual cells - the slower the upstroke, the slower conduction velocity.</p>

<p class="instructions">Here, we have the option of two conduction velocities - normal and slow:

(If you ever need to know what a certain button does, you can click on the <span class="will-highlight-element-on-window" data-el-to-highlight=".tooltips-toggle">help button</span> to activate tooltips)</li>
		<li>Select the button to activate <span class="will-highlight-element-on-window" data-el-to-highlight="label[for='condVel-radio-slow']">slow conduction velocity</span></li>
		<li>Click and drag to select a few of the cells in the <span class="will-highlight-grid-section-on-window" data-grid-section-to-highlight="[[3,0],[19,0]]">top path</span>. You will see a marker on these cells to indicate their conduction velocity is slow.</li>
		<li>Select the button to activate <span class="will-highlight-element-on-window" data-el-to-highlight="label[for='state-radio-depo']">depolarisation</span>, then click on the <span class="will-highlight-grid-section-on-window" data-grid-section-to-highlight="[[0,1],[0,1]]">left-most cell</span> to depolarise it.</li>
		<li>Note the difference in impulse propagation between the two paths.</li>
