<h4>The cell</h4>

<p>The base unit of the cardiac conduction system is <strong>the cardiac myocyte</strong>. Cardiac myocytes are a type of <strong>excitable cell</strong>. This allows them to undergo <strong>action potentials</strong>, in which their usually negative membrane potential temporarily becomes positive due to the closing and opening of membrane channels in a stereotyped fashion. An action potential in one cell can trigger an action potential in neighbouring cells, and in this way an <strong>electrical impulse</strong> can be transmitted across many cells.</p>

<p class="no-mb">In these simulations, we represent each cell as a small square. The color of the cell shows what stage of the action potential it is in:</p>
<div class="square-bullet-list">
		<div class="square-bullet-caption-pair">
			<img src="/static/images/square.png" class="complete-the-square repo-cell-img"> 
			<div> A white color means the cell is fully repolarised and able to start undergoing an action potential if it receives the necessary signal to do so.
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="square-bullet-caption-pair">
			<img src="/static/images/square-depo.png" class="complete-the-square depo-cell-img"> 
			<div> A red color means the cell has has just depolarised (the very beginning of the action potential)
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div class="square-bullet-caption-pair">
			<img src="/static/images/square-refrac.png" class="complete-the-square refrac-cell-img"> 
			<div> A cell that is refractory is orange to yellow, depending on how far along the action potential it is. In this state, it cannot yet start undergoing another action potential, even if it receives the necessary signal to do so.

<p class="instructions">Click on the <span class="will-highlight-element-on-window" data-el-to-highlight=".canvas-parent>canvas">cell</span> to manually depolarise it, and see what happens as the cell undergoes an action potential. Pay attention to its color, as well as the diagram below to see how the color of the square corresponds to its stage of the action potential.</p>
