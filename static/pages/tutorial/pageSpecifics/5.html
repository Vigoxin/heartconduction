<h4>Refractory period length</h4>

<p>The refractory period length of individual cells is another important property of individual cells that has a large effect on impulse propagation at a macroscopic level.</p>

<p class="instructions">Let's compare 3 different refractory period lengths:
	<ol class="instructions">
		<li>Start by clicking on the <span class="will-highlight-grid-section-on-window" data-grid-section-to-highlight="[[0,3],[0,3]]">left-most cell</span> to depolarise it and observe the impulse propagate across the three paths.</li>
		<li>Select the button to activate <span class="will-highlight-element-on-window" data-el-to-highlight="label[for='refracLength-radio-short']">short refractory period</span>, then click and drag to select all the cells in the <span class="will-highlight-grid-section-on-window" data-grid-section-to-highlight="[[2,0],[29,0]]">top path</span></li>
		<li>Select the button to activate <span class="will-highlight-element-on-window" data-el-to-highlight="label[for='refracLength-radio-long']">long refractory period</span>, then click and drag to select all the cells in the <span class="will-highlight-grid-section-on-window" data-grid-section-to-highlight="[[2,6],[29,6]]">bottom path</span></li>
		<li><span class="will-highlight-element-on-window" data-el-to-highlight="label[for='state-radio-depo']">Depolarise</span> the <span class="will-highlight-grid-section-on-window" data-grid-section-to-highlight="[[0,3],[0,3]]">left-most cell</span> and note the difference in impulse propagation between the three paths.</li>
